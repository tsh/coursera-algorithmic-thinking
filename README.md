Algorithmic Thinking

Week 1:
Overview
> For your first project, you will write Python code that creates dictionaries corresponding to some simple examples of graphs. You will also implement two short functions that compute information about the distribution of the in-degrees for nodes in these graphs. You will then use these functions in the Application component of Module 1 where you will analyze the degree distribution of a citation graph for a collection of physics papers. This final portion of module will be peer assessed.
